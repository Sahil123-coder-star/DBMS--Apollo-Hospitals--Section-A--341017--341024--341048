# 🏥 Apollo Hospitals – DBMS Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **relational database design for Apollo Hospitals**, focusing on managing core hospital operations such as patients, doctors, appointments, visits, prescriptions, medications, departments, wards, and billing. The database is designed using MySQL and follows standard DBMS principles. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Model real-world hospital workflows using a relational database  
- Ensure data accuracy through structured schema design  
- Apply DBMS concepts like ER modeling, normalization, and integrity  
- Support efficient querying for hospital operations  

---

## 🗂️ Database Schema (Tables)
- **patient** – Stores patient personal and contact details  
- **doctor** – Stores doctor information and specialization  
- **department** – Hospital departments and location details  
- **appointment** – Scheduling between patients and doctors  
- **visit** – Records actual patient visits and complaints  
- **prescription** – Prescriptions issued during visits  
- **prescription_item** – Medications linked to prescriptions  
- **medication** – Medicine inventory details  
- **invoice** – Billing and payment status for visits  
- **ward** – Ward and bed management

## 🧠 DBMS Concepts Used
- Relational schema design  
- Primary keys and entity relationships  
- Structured data storage  
- ER diagram (designed using MySQL Workbench)  
- Data consistency and integrity  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Tool:** MySQL Workbench (.mwb ER diagram)  
- **Language:** SQL  

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open MySQL Workbench  
2. Execute `apollo_hospital_schema.sql`  
3. Schema `mydb` and all tables will be created  
4. Insert sample data and run queries as required  

---

## 📚 Use Case
This project is intended for **academic DBMS learning**, demonstrating hospital database design using Apollo Hospitals as a case study.
